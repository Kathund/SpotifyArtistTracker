> Due to recent [Spotify API changes](https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2026-02-06-update-on-developer-access-and-platform-security), it is no longer feasible to retrieve artists and their albums in bulk.
> "Big" artists can have upwards of 100+ albums, and fetching them one by one is no longer feasible. It would be inefficient and place unnecessary strain on both the bot and Spotify
